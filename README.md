Great learning , First its logic was thought of thoroughly and written on paper and then the code was typed 
then Code was run multiple times for Quality assurance 
The numberToWords.ts file was converted into tsc numberToWords.ts
node numberToWords.js was run to see the desired results.
This project can take in any lenght of number but Typescript has some number range limitiation
Logic: The given number is divided into set of 3 with counter counting the sets which determines how big the number will
be (for e.g thousand for counter=1, million for counter=2 and so on )
there is a seperate function that converts all numbers <999 into words and return to main function with adds it to the counter array.
