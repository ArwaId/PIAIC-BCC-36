# PIAIC-BCC-36
This is my first Typescript project of Calculator , It has readline-sync library function question that acts same as prompt in console
npm i --save readline-sync
npm i --save @types/readline-sync
It validates the numbers and the operator that was entered and then performs operation.
learnt from the logic that uses the boolean operator and also used TYPE for operators
